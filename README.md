<p><strong><h2>Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns: Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.</h2></strong></p>
<br>
<p>A bit introduction of the project</p><br>
<p>In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have gained a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I have also learnt how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!<p>

  <p>The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.</p>
